1. **Proposal Management**:  
   - Displays a list of submitted proposals along with the time they were submitted (e.g., "Submitted a day ago").  
   - Each proposal entry includes a "Review" button for users to take action on specific proposals.

2. **Integrated PDF Viewer**:  
   - Allows users to view detailed project descriptions directly within the dashboard without needing external tools.  
   - Includes basic navigation options and a full-screen mode for better usability.

3. **User Interface**:  
   - Clean and modern design with a professional appearance.  
   - Uses a dark theme to reduce eye strain and enhance visual appeal.  
   - Employs clear typography and intuitive layouts to ensure ease of navigation.

4. **Additional Functionalities**:  
   - A "Post your requirement" button for submitting new requirements.  
   - A quick link to the organizationâ€™s LinkedIn profile for enhanced connectivity.

### Technical Details:
- **Tech Stack**: The project can be implemented using modern technologies like React.js for the front end and CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS or Bootstrap for styling.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for various devices, ensuring usability on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
- **Future Features**: Potential enhancements include user authentication, search and filter options for proposals, and downloadable PDF export for detailed reports.

### How It Works:
1. Users log in to the dashboard and see a list of submitted proposals.
2. They can click the "Review" button to analyze specific proposals.
3. For detailed insights, users can open the PDF viewer embedded in the interface.
4. New requirements can be posted via the "Post your requirement" button, and users can access additional resources through the LinkedIn link.
